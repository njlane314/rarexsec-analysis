# rarexsec_analysis


Implement: 

-- selection efficiency and purity

-- final state statistics 

-- understand systematic uncertainties

-- prestage prod_strange_resample_fhc_run1_fhc_reco2_reco2 and make sure to use this rather than run2 

-- Is there a way to reconstruct total hadronic invariant mass

-- fiducial volume event category

-- filter out-fv, ext, nc, nue --> then background isolate remaining categories 

-- train uresnet on filtered events

-- train res encoder and series of multilayer perceptrons

-- improve general interface of this code
