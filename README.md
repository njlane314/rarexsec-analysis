-- selection efficiency and purity

-- final state statistics 

-- understand systematic uncertainties

-- filter out-fv, ext, nc, nue --> then background isolate remaining categories 

-- train uresnet on filtered events

-- train res encoder and series of multilayer perceptrons

-- improve general interface of this code
